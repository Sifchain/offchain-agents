# Adjust Swap Fee Rate to Market

# Given data

minimum_swap_fee_rate = 0.005 # Minimum swap fee as a decimal (0.5%)

# Step 1: Calculate the Price Difference (Delta P)

delta_price = price_sifchain - price_osmosis

# Step 2: Determine Swap Fee Rate Based on Maximum of Price Difference and Minimum Fee

swap_fee_rate = max(delta_price / price_osmosis, minimum_swap_fee_rate)

# For demonstration, let's use the same hypothetical investment amount of $1000

hypothetical_investment = 1000

# Step 3: Calculate Total Swap Fee for the Hypothetical Investment

total_swap_fee_hypothetical = swap_fee_rate \* hypothetical_investment

# Step 4: Calculate Final Amount and Profit/Loss for the Hypothetical Investment

final_amount_hypothetical = (hypothetical_investment / price_sifchain) \* price_osmosis - total_swap_fee_hypothetical
profit_or_loss_hypothetical = final_amount_hypothetical - hypothetical_investment

swap_fee_rate, total_swap_fee_hypothetical, final_amount_hypothetical, profit_or_loss_hypothetical
